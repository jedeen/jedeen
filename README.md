Hello, I'm Jae! I’m a software engineer who’s enthusiastic about accessibility, maintainability, and design. I’ve worked for over ten years in front-end, infrastructure, and back-end roles across various industries.

I also make games, and help maintain [Excalibur.js](https://github.com/excaliburjs), a 2D HTML5 game engine.
