Hello, I'm Jae! I’m a software developer who’s enthusiastic about accessibility, maintainability, and design. I’ve worked for over twelve years in front-end, infrastructure, and back-end roles across various industries.

I also make games, and help maintain [Excalibur.js](https://github.com/excaliburjs), a 2D game engine for the web.

You can find more of my work at [edeen.dev](https://edeen.dev/).
